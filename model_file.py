Docfiy is an online healthcare platform that connects users with certified doctors for quick, reliable consultations, prescriptions, and medical certificates — all from the comfort of your home.

2. How does an online consultation work on Docfiy?
Simply submit your symptoms on the website. Based on your inputs, a qualified doctor will review your case and respond via chat or call with medical advice, a prescription (if needed), or a medical certificate.

3. What kind of health concerns can I consult for?
You can consult for common issues like fever, cold, cough, sore throat, fatigue, minor infections, skin problems, period issues, and more. Serious or emergency cases should still be taken to a hospital.
